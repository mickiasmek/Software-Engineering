Problem Statement:

An array is said to be dual if its number of elements is a multiple of 4 and each pair of consecutive elements, sum to the same value. Write a function named, isDual that accepts an array of integers and returns true if the array is dual, otherwise it returns false. e.g if the input array is {1, 2, 3, 0}, true is returned because 1+2 == 3+0 == 3; if the input is {1, 1, 2, 2}, false is returned because 1+1 == 2 != 2+2; if the input is {1,2,3}, false is returned because the number of elements in the array is not multiple of 4.
